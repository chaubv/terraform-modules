Hi Support Team

I have not root acount. I need change from plan support Business to Basic.
Please support this issus.

Rose:Hi, my name is Rose. I'm here to help you today! Please allow me a moment to review your case.
Me:Hi
I have not root account. Currently, I want to change plan support from Business to Basic. Can you please support this problem help me?
Rose:Hey, I see that your IAM user has billing permissions, so I believe you should be able to change your support plan. Have you tried it already? If not, I'm happy to tell you how.
Me:I tried it but IAM user not permissions change support plan.
message of aws "You must sign in with root account credentials (email address and password) to change your support plan"
Rose:I see... Unfortunately, we're not able to change the support plan on your behalf.
Are you the one who created the account? Or was it someone else?
Me:No, My friend created the account, thank you.
Rose:Oh, I see. I'd love to help you, but they (the root user) will need to change the plan themselves, or give you access to the root user credentials.
Me:Ok. I will contact to my friend, Thank.
Rose:You're more than welcome! Is there anything else you need today?
Me:No, I don't.
good bye.
